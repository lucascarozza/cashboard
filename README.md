## My Journey
This project was developed as part of my studies at Rocketseat and helped me deepen my understanding of structuring financial data. Implementing json-server as a mock API made it easier to manage and retrieve transaction records efficiently. Working on this strengthened my ability to organize and handle financial information in a structured, user-friendly way.
